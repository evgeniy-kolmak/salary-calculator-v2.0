## About

Great solution for small businesses. Salary calculator for employees. It is quite easy to use, as well as all this complements a nice laconic design.

## Documentation

To start, you need the number of **hours worked** and the **tariff**. Almost everything else counts from this amount. Percentage of bonus, experience, professional skills.

+ Harmfulness is considered separately, at a standard rate.

+ Night hours and a one-time bonus are also calculated in their own way.

+ All information is displayed in one list. Tax deductions are at the bottom.
